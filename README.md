This project was created to control smart LED lights. Basically, it can control the brightness, colour of the lights. Also, themes, which contain settings for a group of lights, can be used to simplify settings for a certain situation, e.g. reading books at night.

I am open-sourcing my personal projects like this one from [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) hoping that it would be useful to others, too.
